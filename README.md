# ShareIt! daemon

Jesús Leganés Combarro "Piranna" - [piranna@gmail.com]

This folder contains a ShareIt! client developed as a system daemon on Node.js.
It's purpose is to run stand-alone on head-less machines so it can be queried
from remote machines or properly configured ShareIt! clients (maybe just one
served by the own daemon) allowing the same functionality but working on an
unnatended, always connected machine.

It's main purpose is to serve as a backend to be controlled from mobile phones.
